&lt;font:Palatino Linotype:30&gt;Changelog&lt;just:left&gt;&lt;font:Palatino Linotype:18&gt;
Stable: Was tested to be safe and usually approved by RTB file moderators.
Public Beta: Was either hosted on a public server for people to try out or released by post (not uploaded to the add-ons section as official) to find bugs.
Private Beta: Was released amongst our beta testers.
Skipped: This version was skipped from stable release for certain reasons.
Version 6.12 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed singleplayer/host's variables not working bug (created by the loading save bugfix)
Version 6.11 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Function arguments now work correctly
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed v20 loading saves bug
Version 6.1 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed more than one word variables not working in if checks, this should fix the problems people were having with the version 6 update
   &lt;li&gt; Added VCE_relayCallFunction &lt;Direction&gt;, for calling functions on bricks near by (requires full trust with the colliding brick)
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed a few bugs that I never knew about
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:player:*&gt; was actually checking the triggering client's player inside Player -&gt; VCE_ifVariable
      &lt;subli&gt; Client -&gt; VCE_modVariable & VCE_ifVariable was mistaking the client you were trying to change the variable on for for the processing/triggering client
      &lt;subli&gt; Fixed ifHost replacer
   &lt;li&gt; If the minimum number or max number is not set for the Random variable modding method it will now set it to a random float instead
   &lt;li&gt; You can now use variable replacers in most VCE output event text boxes
      &lt;subli&gt; VCE_modVariable variable names accept variable replacers, ifVariable, etc
   &lt;li&gt; Removed annoying "This server has VCE %version" message
      &lt;subli&gt; If you still want it you can set $Pref::Client::ShowVCEHandshake to 1 or look in the console as it says it in there when you join a server
Version 6.01 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed enabling and disabling events
Version 6.00 (Stable, Private Beta):
   &lt;li&gt; You can now directly modify certain special replacers, changes will be applied to a handling function
      &lt;subli&gt; (meaning if you change "clanPrefix" it will automatically call a function and apply your changes, ie. set their clan prefix)
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:client:clanPrefix&gt;, &lt;var:client:clanSuffix&gt;
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:client:decal&gt;, &lt;var:client:face&gt;
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:player:health&gt;, &lt;var:player:damage&gt;, &lt;var:player:energy&gt;, &lt;var:player:vel&gt; (x, y, z)
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:player:currentItem&gt;, &lt;var:player:item1&gt; -&gt; &lt;var:player:item5&gt;
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:brick:colorid&gt;, &lt;var:brick:printcount&gt;, &lt;var:brick:printname&gt;
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:brick:name&gt;, &lt;var:brick:colorfxid&gt;, &lt;var:brick:printid&gt;, &lt;var:brick:shapefxid&gt;
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;var:vehicle:health&gt;, &lt;var:vehicle:damage&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; Sub data can now contain logic
      &lt;subli&gt; ~= 2 -- processes all event lines that have a 2 in their digits (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, ...)
      &lt;subli&gt; != 2 -- processes all event lines except 2 (0, 1, 3, 4, ...)
      &lt;subli&gt; == 2 -- processes only event line 2 (2)
      &lt;subli&gt; &gt;= 2 -- processes all event lines larger than/equal to 2 (2, 3, 4, 5)
      &lt;subli&gt; &gt; 2 -- processes all event lines smaller than 2 (0, 1)
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;= 2 -- processes all event lines smaller than/equal to 2 (0, 1, 2)
   &lt;li&gt; You can now use | and & in ifVariable and ifValue. & for an AND operator and | for an OR operator.
      &lt;subli&gt; Example &lt;var:client:score&gt; & &lt;var:client:bl_id&gt; == 1337
         &lt;subli&gt;Computes to: Is the client's score and bl_id equal to 1337?
   &lt;li&gt; Bug fixes
      &lt;subli&gt; There was a massive bug in VCE_stateFunction (mindless copy pasta is not good)
      &lt;subli&gt; Other bug fixes I can't remember
   &lt;li&gt; Seperated the code into seperate files for easier reading
      &lt;subli&gt; All of the code is pretty easy to look at, if you want to learn something
         &lt;subli&gt; Except for outputs.cs... it's as dirty as Clockturn's mum
   &lt;li&gt; Increased all VCE output events' textbox character limit
   &lt;li&gt; Manual now caches to make reading the manual faster
   &lt;li&gt; Avoided adding the 3rd client tab... again :D
Version 5.81 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; VERY important bug fix
Version 5.8 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Added new replacers for the client target (decal,face,chest,hip,hat,accent,rleg,rarm,lleg,larm)
   &lt;li&gt; Added new replacer for the player target (speed)
   &lt;li&gt; Added new global replacers (hour,minute,second... good for real-time clocks)
Version 5.7 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed centerprintall and bottomprintall so that %1 works
   &lt;li&gt; Made VCE_ifVariable and VCE_modVariable for minigames
   &lt;li&gt; &lt;var:vehicle:maxhealth&gt;,&lt;var:vehicle:health&gt;,&lt;var:global:brickcount&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; &lt;var:brick:ownername&gt;, &lt;var:brick:ownerbl_id&gt;, &lt;var:client:brickcount&gt;, &lt;var:player:energy&gt;
Version 5.61 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Made it so all inputs have a bot target
      &lt;subli&gt; The bot target will only work on vehicle spawns
   &lt;li&gt; Some other minor stuff I can't remember
Version 5.6 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Added onVariableUpdate. Triggered when VCE_modVariable is called on the brick, or when a varlink is clicked.
   &lt;li&gt; Added &lt;varlink:linkname_varname:value&gt; for having links that you can click to set variables. 
      &lt;subli&gt; For example, &lt;varlink:Click here_gold:1&gt; will appear as a blue "Click here" link, which when clicked will set the client's "gold" variable to 1. Use with onVariableUpdate to do something when the client's click the link.
Version 5.5 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Added &lt;var:client:clanPrefix&gt; and &lt;var:client:clanSuffix&gt; - self explanatory
   &lt;li&gt; Added ~= logic operator for every variable check. It checks if the value you enter on the right side of the operator is inside the value on the left side
      &lt;subli&gt; 100 ~= 10; will trigger onVariableTrue because 10 is inside the string of 100
   &lt;li&gt;Added VCE_retroCheck output for bricks. For all you whiners for lack of if* events. Has all of the old if* events in one event
Version 5.43 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed %1 not working in minigames
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed displaying variables glitching up sometimes
   &lt;li&gt; Made the manual pop up the first time you use variables and open the event gui
Version 5.42 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed general shit
Version 5.41 (Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; 'Global' special replacers (date, time, windows, macintosh, simtime, servername, port, maxplayercount, playercount)
   &lt;li&gt; Fixed replacers sometimes displaying as the normal text without being replaced with values
   &lt;li&gt; Added VCE_modVariable to each target
Version 5.40 (Private Beta, Stable):
   &lt;li&gt; Extensive update on the client-side of VCE (access menu by wrench events menu or bind a control)
      &lt;subli&gt; Manual: Updates with the internet within 1 second (faster then the dropbox one, some sort of spam protection on dropbox?)
      &lt;subli&gt; Changelog: Read this file in game with pretty icons lol
      &lt;subli&gt; &lt;color:FF0000&gt;Coming in v5.41&lt;color:1E1E1E&gt; - Online: View and post tutorials on vce (or events in general?)

   &lt;li&gt; Multiple variable events, using 'sub data'
